                    |After outsanding volunteer work at the festival the year prior (2017) I was offered a position at the festival as a "staff leader"
                    |My task with the festival has been to run a kiosk and a caf√©. Before
                    |the festival I've helped reform many of the systems in place to help make it a smoother running
                    |system of cogs, and have gotten lots of recognition for this.
                    |During the festival I've been responsible for training volunteers, providing them with the
                    |resources they need to do their jobs, place orders, and all other kinds of coordination related tasks, essentially acting as a manager
                    |for two locations at once. My position with Riddu has allowed me to improve my skills handling stress and coordination of large, intricate tasks
                    |and has forced me to get used to thinking on my feet. While planning is important, being able to handle all the small changes on the fly without it
                    |ruining these plans is a skill on it's own that I'm glad Riddu taught me.

                    |With Shell I've been working as a sales associate, focusing on selling food and beverages, as well as some car related
                    |products. With Shell I have taken away a lot of experience with proper customer service, how to handle customers who can be
                    |<i>difficult</i>, and how to handle stress even better as it is a large part of an often hectic workday with tasks to be done and
                    |many customers to be served.
