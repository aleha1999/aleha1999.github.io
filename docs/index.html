I was born and raised in this city, but I'm aching to explore the world, and my own country.
Ever since I was 12 years old I have been highly interested in all topics related to computer science,
and quickly knew to pursue a career within the field. Today I am versed in many programming languages, and
have thousands upon thousands of hours of practice under the belt. Specifically related to web development.</p><p>When I first learned to program it quickly became apparent to me that web development was the route I wanted to go down
It's such a flexible technology, and with such a wide reach, I certainly think it's the future of computing, and therefore
have a lot of experience with web development from many perspectives, and would love a job within the field.</p><p>I love learning, which makes me a flexible candidate for any new work environment. I also love challenges, and enjoy
testing myself. I'm lively, engaged, effective, and tidy, at least for the most part.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" id="education"><div class="content"><h1>Education</h1><div class="education"><p>2015-2018</p><div class="pill"><p>Kongsbakken High School</p><p>Science and Technology</p></div><div class="sep"></div><p>2018-2021</p><div class="pill"><p>University of Tromsø (UiT)</p><p>Computer Science bachelors</p></div><div class="sep"></div><p>2021-2023</p><div class="pill to-come"><p>University of Tromsø (UiT)</p><p>Master's degree computer Science</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" id="experience"><div class="content"><h1>Work experience</h1><div class="experience"><div class="meta"><p class="name">AS Hugo Ellingsen</p><p class="position">In house software developer</p><p class="date">2015 - ...</p></div><div class="body"><p>For hugo Ellingsen I work as a form of freelance developer. Developing and maintaining projects, mostly in my spare time
they have given me many opportunities to create and maintain applications of different scale and uses, both for web, mobile, and kiosk
purposes and have given me a great environment to create and learn beyond just development, but also maintaining applications in production.</p></div><div class="meta"><p class="name">The Riddu Festival</p><p class="position">Staff leader - Catering</p><p class="date">Summer 2018, 2019 - ...</p></div><div class="body"><p>After outsanding volunteer work at the festival the year prior (2017) I was offered a position at the festival as a "staff leader"
My task with the festival has been to run a kiosk and a café. Before
the festival I've helped reform many of the systems in place to help make it a smoother running
system of cogs, and have gotten lots of recognition for this.
During the festival I've been responsible for training volunteers, providing them with the
resources they need to do their jobs, place orders, and all other kinds of coordination related tasks, essentially acting as a manager
for two locations at once. My position with Riddu has allowed me to improve my skills handling stress and coordination of large, intricate tasks
and has forced me to get used to thinking on my feet. While planning is important, being able to handle all the small changes on the fly without it
ruining these plans is a skill on it's own that I'm glad Riddu taught me.</p></div><div class="meta"><p class="name">Shell</p><p class="position">Sales associate</p><p class="date">May 2018 - October 2020</p></div><div class="body"><p>With Shell I've been working as a sales associate, focusing on selling food and beverages, as well as some car related
products. With Shell I have taken away a lot of experience with proper customer service, how to handle customers who can be
<i>difficult</i>, and how to handle stress even better as it is a large part of an often hectic workday with tasks to be done and
many customers to be served.</p></div><div class="meta"><p class="name">UiT</p><p class="position">IT - AV support</p><p class="date">August 2020 - ...</p></div><div class="body"><p>For UiT I'm working with providing IT support regarding AV equipment on many of their hundreds of AV equipped rooms.

technologies fitting into a web-development and general tech stack. Below you find a
list of the stuff I'm best at. Note that this is only scraping at the surface of my knowledge level
with different technologies, it's just the highlights. Please take me in for an interview to learn more of my skills and knowledge.<div class="tech-container"><div class="tech"><i class="fab fa-angular"></i><p>Angular</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fab fa-node-js"></i><p>Node JS</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fab fa-node"></i><p>Express</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fa fa-database"></i><p>MySQL</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fa fa-globe"></i><p>JS, CSS, HTML5</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fa fa-code"></i><p>TypeScript</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fa fa-code"></i><p>PHP</p></div><div class="tech"><i class="fab fa-python"></i><p>Python</p></div></div></div></div><div class="section" id="portfolio"><div class="content"><div class="intro"><div class="body"><h1>Portfolio</h1><p> Over the past few years I've gotten to test the water of

That said, below you find listed pretty much all the other projects I have done.</p></div></div><div class="project" style="background-image:url(b071a8a1916f9f08f58a7905e236e5f3.jpg)"><div class="fade"><div class="body"><h1>Hugo Ellingsen Tannteknisk Laboratorium AS's home website</h1><p>Having worked as a form of "part time freelancer" on behalf of Hugo Ellingsen for a number of years
I was given the task of designing and creating a brand spanking new website in 2020. The site needed
flexibility, therefore WordPress was chosen as the CMS for the site, but also a slick design that would
blow competing dental laboratories out of the water. Hugo Ellingsen in that way offered me an experimental
platform where I could create a custom design and put it into the wild, without the risks of a more private
customer purchasing a site from me. That way I got a great learning experience in making wordpress themes and
putting them into the wild, to meet the needs of a business, without any dangerous traps.</p></div></div></div><div class="project" style="background-image:url(d89a00c459ad855d20b2a493acfa298b.png)"><div class="fade"><div class="body"><h1>Simshjelpen's website</h1><p>Simshjelpen is a form of news/general content website regarding The Sims franchise. The site needed to be able
to have dynamic content, pages, wide features in the editors, and wide plugin support. Therefore WordPress was yet again
chosen as the go-to CMS. For the site I developed a completely custom theme that helps convey the site's information in a simple,
clean manner. Since the site is mostly conveying content through social media and search engine clicks a focus was put on optimizing
SEO, and on making the article and page designs nice and sleek, rather than putting a lot of time into the other parts of the site.</p></div></div></div><div class="project" style="background-image:url(a0986055182e9c9e46a4724804432c5f.png)"><div class="fade"><div class="body"><h1>Tromsø Tannlegesenter's home site</h1><p> In 2018 I was tasked with making Tromsø Tannlegesenter a new home website.
Through thorough communication with the team I helped them design a new logo,
and make a whole new website that they could actually use. Migrating from an old,
static HTML site that was hard to update, and with nobody to maintain it, to a new site
that is WordPress based, meaning mostly self maintained, and with me aiding them in maintenance
on rare occasion. Compared to Hugo Ellingsen's new website they needed a theme that was proven feature rich and that worked, and a premade
wordpress theme was therefore chosen. I will have to admit that my design skills have grown since then, finding many flaws
with the website today, but I am actively intending to help iron them out over time.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section" id="contact"><div class="content"><h1>Contact me</h1><p> I'm always looking for work. If you're interested in me and my skillset
